1. Establish the Goal (Non-Negotiable)

The user sets:

Current weight

Goal weight

Timeframe (weeks)

From this, the system calculates one fixed daily calorie deficit required to hit that goal.

This deficit does not change unless the goal or timeframe changes.

The goal defines the direction. The system’s job is to decide how to reach it.

2. Use BMR as the Baseline

BMR represents calories burned at rest.

BMR is the starting point for all calculations.

All movement (steps, workouts, cardio) adds calories on top of BMR.

Food intake is measured against BMR + activity, not against TDEE estimates.

BMR is the floor. Movement adds flexibility.

3. Apply Safety Limits

Daily calories should not drop below safe levels unless activity capacity has already been maximized.

Minimum daily intake:

Men: ~1500 calories

Women: ~1200 calories

Or ~75% of BMR (whichever is higher)

The system should always attempt to increase movement before pushing calories lower.

4. Choose Strategy Bias (Lifestyle Preference, Not Math)

The user chooses how they prefer to achieve the deficit:

Diet-focused → more deficit from food, less from activity

Balanced → even split between food and activity

Activity-focused → more deficit from movement, less from food

Strategy bias affects distribution, not the size of the deficit.

5. Determine Willingness to Move

The user selects how active they are willing to be (minimal, moderate, very active).

This sets expectations and upper bounds for:

Daily steps (up to 20,000/day)

Strength training (up to 6 sessions/week)

These are maximum limits, not defaults.

6. Movement-First Rule for Aggressive Goals

If the required daily deficit is large (e.g. aggressive fat loss):

The system must follow this order:

Increase daily steps (up to 20k)

Increase strength training frequency (up to 6×/week)

Account for protein’s thermic effect

Only then reduce daily calories further

Calories should not be pushed very low if movement capacity is still unused.

7. Build the Deficit From Two Sources

The total daily deficit must always equal the goal’s required deficit and come from:

Activity burn (steps + workouts)

Food reduction (eating below BMR + activity)

The system allocates the deficit according to:

Strategy bias

Activity willingness

Safety constraints

8. Ensure the Numbers Always Add Up

Before saving or displaying results:

Calories burned from activity plus

Calories reduced from food
must equal the required daily deficit exactly.

If they don’t:

Automatically rebalance activity and food until they do.

9. Generate Clear, Actionable Outputs

Once everything balances, the system outputs:

Daily calorie target

Step goal (within 20k max)

Strength training frequency (within 6×/week)

Protein target (to protect lean mass and support metabolism)

These outputs should feel achievable, aligned, and internally consistent.
