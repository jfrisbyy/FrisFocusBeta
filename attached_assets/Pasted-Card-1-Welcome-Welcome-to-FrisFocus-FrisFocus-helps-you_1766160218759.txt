Card 1 — Welcome
Welcome to FrisFocus
FrisFocus helps you organize your life around what actually matters and follow through with structure, accountability, and visibility.
This isn’t about doing more.
 It’s about doing what matters, consistently.
You can start solo or build with others.
You can keep things simple or make it competitive.
You can adjust anytime.
There’s no perfect setup — just one that fits you right now.


Card 2 — Seasons Give Direction (also show on tasks page)
Start With a Season
Life doesn’t stay static — your goals, responsibilities, and energy change over time.
 FrisFocus is built to move with you.
A Season represents a phase of your life, usually lasting a few months, where you define what matters right now — without locking yourself into a single path.
A Season can include multiple priorities, such as:
fitness or body goals


athletic training or performance


discipline and consistency


mental clarity or balance


career, school, or personal growth


Seasons aren’t about narrowing your life down to one thing.
 They help you organize your effort around what’s relevant in this chapter — and adjust as life shifts.
Your Season doesn’t need to be perfect.
 Clarity comes from action, not overplanning.

Card 3 — Tasks, To-Dos, and Personal Points (also show on daily and tasks page)
How Your Daily System Works
FrisFocus separates repeatable habits from one-time responsibilities — so everything has its place.
Tasks (Repeatable Habits)
 Tasks represent actions you repeat regularly to support your current Season — like workouts, training sessions, journaling, recovery habits, or daily routines.
Tasks are checked off daily and earn personal points when completed.
 They form the foundation of your consistency.
You’re not limited to a fixed number of tasks.
 Create as many as make sense — then score them based on importance, not frequency.

To-Do Lists (One-Time Actions)
 To-Dos are for things that don’t repeat — like:
doctor’s appointments


errands


meetings


admin tasks


You can add:
a daily to-do list


a weekly to-do list for flexible, non-urgent items


To-Dos help you stay organized without cluttering your habit system.

Milestones & Due Dates
 Milestones represent major goals you want to complete in the near future — like buying a car, finishing a project, or preparing for an event.
Due dates help you track time-sensitive items such as:
bills


assignments


deadlines


Together, they give structure to both long-term goals and immediate responsibilities.

Daily & Weekly Point Goals
You set:
a daily personal point goal


a weekly personal point goal


Completing tasks earns personal points that roll up toward those goals.
 This is your private system — designed to keep you aligned and intentional day to day.
Important actions should carry more weight than optional ones, so scoring reflects what truly matters.

Breaking Habits & Reinforcing Good Ones
You can also:
add penalties for habits you’re trying to reduce (awareness, not punishment)


add boosters that reward consistency, streaks, or hitting weekly goals repeatedly


If you’re unsure how to structure your tasks, scoring, penalties, or milestones, AI can help you explore realistic setups based on:
your goals


available time


training intensity


lifestyle constraints


You stay in control.
 AI supports your thinking — it doesn’t replace it.


Card 4 — Focus Points (also show as question mark on focus point activity drawer when expanded)
The Universal Score
Focus Points are a separate, universal point system used to reflect outcomes and compare progress across people and groups.
Unlike personal points, Focus Points are not tied to specific tasks.
They’re earned by:
hitting daily or weekly goals
staying consistent over time
completing workouts or training sessions
participating in Circles
winning challenges or competitions
reaching milestones
Focus Points allow you to:
compare progress without exposing your personal task system
compete fairly across different goals and sports
track momentum, not micromanagement
Personal points are how you work.
Focus Points are what the outcome looks like.

Card 5 —(also show on fitness page) Fitness & Sports — Built for Everyday Life and Serious Training
FrisFocus includes a fully integrated fitness and sports system designed for everyone — from everyday people prioritizing their health to serious athletes training with intent.
Whether you’re:
focused on general health and movement


trying to lose, gain, or maintain weight


rebuilding consistency after time off


training casually for enjoyment


preparing for competition or performance


FrisFocus adapts to your level, goals, and lifestyle.
It supports:
beginners and people just getting started


recreational athletes


competitive athletes


serious and high-volume trainers


You can track:
workouts and strength training


cardio, conditioning, and endurance


nutrition and calorie intake


body metrics and long-term trends


sport-specific training and performance sessions


Sports tracking is template-based and fully customizable.
 Basketball, running, swimming, and other sports use tailored fields — and you can edit or create your own templates to match how you train.
AI is available throughout the fitness experience to help you:
clarify fitness or body goals at any level


estimate calories burned


estimate calories eaten


understand patterns in your data


adjust goals intelligently as training or life demands change


Your fitness data stays connected to your broader life system — not isolated in a separate app.
FrisFocus meets you where you are —
 and grows with you as your goals evolve.


Card 6 — Accountability, Circles & Competition (also show on community page)
Use Accountability When It Helps
FrisFocus works solo — but becomes more powerful with others.
You can create or join Circles with:
friends
family
teams
classrooms
coaches and athletes
accountability partners
Circles support:
shared goals and milestones
badges and recognition
leaderboards and rankings
one-on-one challenges
Circle vs Circle competitions
FrisFocus is also a full social platform.
You can:
post updates, reflections, or wins to the feed
journal publicly or privately
interact with friends and Circles
send direct messages for support, planning, or accountability
Competition is optional and fully customizable.
Use it when it motivates you. Turn it down when it doesn’t.
FrisFocus adapts to how you work best — whether that’s quiet consistency or visible competition.


Card 7 — Make It Yours
Customize Your Experience
FrisFocus is built to adapt to you.
You can:
customize your dashboard by adding or removing cards
focus only on what’s relevant to you
switch between light and dark mode
personalize your welcome message
choose what insights appear first
You can also send cheerlines — short encouragement messages — to friends or Circle members.
Cheerlines show up directly on their dashboard as a reminder that someone’s rooting for them.
Your system should feel personal, flexible, and supportive — not rigid.

Card 8 — Reflect, Learn, and Adjust
Progress Comes From Awareness
Use journaling, summaries, and insights to reflect on:
what’s working
what feels heavy
where energy is leaking
what needs adjusting
FrisFocus is designed to evolve with you.
You’re allowed to refine your setup, reset goals, and rebuild structure whenever life changes.

Card 9 — 
Build the System That Fits Your Life
You don’t need to use every feature.
You don’t need to get it perfect.
Start where you are.
Use what helps.
Adjust when needed.
FrisFocus is here to support progress — not pressure.

If you want next:
a shortened version for mobile onboarding
AI tier callouts (Basic vs Full)
or a coach/athlete-specific onboarding path
say the word.
