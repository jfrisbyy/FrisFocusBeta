Card 31 - Community page
Friends: Shared Progress, Personal Support
FrisFocus lets you add friends to share progress, stay connected, and support each other along the way — without distracting from your personal system.
Friends don’t change your goals.
They make consistency easier.

Card 32 - Community page
Sharing Progress
When you add friends, you can choose to share what you would like, including task completions, streaks and milestones, progress updates, fitness data, but your structure stays personal — visibility is optional and intentional. Not all friends need the same level of visibility. 

Card 33 - Community Page
Circles are shared spaces where progress is visible and accountability is mutual,transforming goals into shared commitments.
Instead of everyone working alone, members follow a common task list and build consistency together. Perfect for teams, friends, or families who want accountability to feel collaborative — not forced.

Awards and Badges help turn shared effort into something tangible — without losing the focus on growth, and you can tie real life rewards to them if it makes sense for your circle!

Feed: Shared Progress, Not Noise
The Feed is a simple space to share progress, reflections, and wins with the FrisFocus community.
 It’s not about likes or performance — it’s about visibility, encouragement, and momentum.
Posts can be quick or thoughtful — whatever fits the moment.



Card 37 - Insights Page 
Insights is your personal AI assistant — built around your data and your goals.
It analyzes patterns across your tasks, habits, streaks, and seasons to help you understand what’s working, what’s not, and where small changes can make the biggest difference.
Think of it as a reflective partner that helps you spot trends, stay aligned, and make smarter decisions — without guessing.

Customize Your Insights Assistant
Your Insights assistant isn’t one-size-fits-all — you can shape how it works for you.
By clicking the setting gear, you can give it instructions about:
how you like feedback delivered


what you want it to prioritize (discipline, balance, flexibility, performance)


how strict or supportive you want it to be


personal context that helps it understand you better


The more you guide it, the better it reflects your values, goals, and preferences.





Card 39- Journal page

Journal: Reflection That Connects the Dots
The Journal is a space to capture thoughts, reflections, and check-ins as you move through your days.
 It’s designed to help you slow down, make sense of your progress, and notice patterns that aren’t always visible in the moment.
Entries can be quick notes, honest reflections, lessons learned, moments worth remembering, whatever you need it to be!
Your journal stays personal — but it works alongside your tasks, seasons, and insights to give your growth context.
