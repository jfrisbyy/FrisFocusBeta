Core Goal

AI assigns points so that completing a reasonable set of meaningful tasks naturally lands you near your daily Focus Goal (e.g., 50), without inflation or punishment.

Not:

“Big tasks always = big points”

“Everything is 5 points”

Or dopamine farming

But:

Points reflect relative importance + effort + frequency

The system self-balances based on the user’s day

Step 1: Establish Hard Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

These are rules the AI must obey.

1️⃣ Daily Focus Point Target (DFPT)

Example:

User’s daily goal = 50 Focus Points

This is the budget.

2️⃣ Expected Completion Band

People don’t complete 100% of tasks.

So we assume:

60–75% completion on a good day

That means:

Total points created should usually land around 65–80 points

Completing most of them → ~50 earned

📌 This is key: points are assigned with expected incompletion baked in

Step 2: Task Classification (AI-Assisted)

When a task is created, the AI classifies it along four axes (0–1 scale internally):

A. Importance (Impact)

How much this task moves the user’s life forward

Critical (health, income, deadlines)

Supportive

Maintenance

Optional

B. Effort / Friction

Mental + physical cost

Low friction (send email)

Medium (gym session)

High (deep work, long workout, studying)

C. Frequency

How often this task appears

Daily

Weekly

Occasional

One-off

📌 High-frequency tasks get fewer points per instance
(so habits don’t drown the system)

D. User Priority Bias

From:

Seasons

Declared goals

Past behavior

Example:

User says “Fitness is important”

But only completes workouts 3×/week
→ AI weights fitness moderately, not blindly

Step 3: Point Allocation Logic (Simple but Powerful)
Base Rule

No single task should be able to “win the day” alone.

Hard caps:

Max task value: 20–25% of daily goal
→ If daily goal = 50 → max task = 10–12 points

Practical Point Bands
Task Type	Typical Points
Tiny admin	1–2
Normal task	3–4
Important habit (workout)	5–7
High-impact deep work	7–10
Rare, heavy task	10–12
Step 4: Example (Your Scenario)

Daily Goal: 50
Tasks Created: 20

AI logic:

Expected completion ≈ 65% → ~13 tasks

13 tasks × avg 4 points ≈ 52 points → perfect

Example Breakdown
Task	Reasoning	Points
Workout	High importance, medium effort, frequent	6
Deep work block	High importance, high effort	8
Meal prep	Health support, medium effort	4
Clean room	Maintenance	3
Respond to emails	Low effort	2
Stretching	Habit, low friction	2
Read	Supportive	3
Optional task	Low priority	1–2

Nothing feels inflated.
Nothing feels pointless.
Completing the right tasks wins the day.

Step 5: AI Adjustment Pass (This Is the Magic)

After task creation, AI runs a normalization pass:

“If the user completed the most important tasks today, would they land near their daily goal?”

If:

Too easy → scale down low-importance tasks

Too hard → gently scale up core tasks

This keeps:

Point economy stable

No manual tuning

No min-maxing

Step 6: How You Phrase This to Users (Important)

You do NOT say:

“AI calculates your points”

You say:

“FrisFocus helps balance your day so the things that matter most naturally carry more weight.”

That feels:

Intentional

Calm

Coach-like

Not creepy
