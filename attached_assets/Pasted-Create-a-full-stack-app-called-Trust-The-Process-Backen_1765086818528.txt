Create a full-stack app called Trust The Process.

Backend: Node + Express. Use a simple JSON file or Replit DB for storage.

Implement these models:

Task: { id, name, value, category, group, isBooster }

DayLog: { date, completedTaskIds, notes, dailyPoints }

WeekSummary (computed only): { weekStart, dailyTotals, weekTotal, boostersApplied, finalWeekPoints }.

Implement these endpoints:

GET /v1/tasks – return all tasks.

POST /v1/tasks – create a new task.

PUT /v1/tasks/:id – update a task.

DELETE /v1/tasks/:id – delete a task.

GET /v1/days?from&to – get a list of DayLogs within the date range.

GET /v1/days/:date – get a single DayLog.

POST /v1/days – upsert a DayLog. Body: { date, completedTaskIds, notes }. Server should:

look up each task’s value,

sum positive values,

sum negative values,

store dailyPoints = total.

GET /v1/weeks/:weekStart – compute the WeekSummary from 7 DayLogs starting at weekStart.

weekTotal = sum of dailyPoints.

boostersApplied is an array of booster task IDs that qualify. For now, implement 3 boosters:

booster_5of7_tracking (+10 pts) if at least 5 of the 7 days have a DayLog.

booster_finish_bible_book (+10 pts) – triggered when a DayLog includes a special task ID.

booster_3days_lifting (+10 pts) – triggered when at least 3 DayLogs contain a ‘lifting’ task.

finalWeekPoints = weekTotal + sum of booster values.

Frontend:

Dashboard page:

Show this week’s total points and color based on thresholds (green > 400, yellow 250–400, red < 250).

Show a small table of dates vs dailyPoints.

Daily page:

Date picker (default today).

Checklist of all tasks grouped by category.

When the user checks/unchecks tasks, it calls POST /v1/days and shows the updated dailyPoints.

Tasks management page:

List of tasks with value and category.

Simple form to add/edit tasks.

Make the UI clean and dark-theme styled, with the title ‘Trust The Process’ and use the same color idea as the sheet: green for positives/strong weeks, red for penalties, yellow for mid.
Also generate a minimal OpenAPI 3.1 spec (openapi.yaml) for these endpoints so I can plug this into a Custom GPT later.”
