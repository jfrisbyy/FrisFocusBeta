Goal:
 Refactor the current “Badges” system into a clear Recognition framework with two distinct concepts: Badges (personal) and Stamps (community), while preserving the integrity of the Focus Points system.


1. Rename & Structure
Rename the Badges page to Recognition


Recognition contains three sections:


Focus Points – explanation and stats of current focus points and what led to them 
Badges – personal, task-bound achievements


Stamps – community-wide, platform-verified achievements



2. Badges (Personal)
Definition:
Badges are personal achievements


Tied to the user’s own tasks, habits, streaks, or goals


Not meant for comparison across users


Rules:
Badge criteria are user-specific, users can create them or use AI to generate them


Badges may be private or semi-private by default


Badges reinforce identity (e.g., consistency, discipline, habits)


Examples:
“30 Workouts Logged”- 


“7-Day Deep Work Streak”


“Early Riser”


“Meal Prep Master”


While all of these badges are tied specifically to the user’s tasks from the task list 

3. Stamps (Community)
Definition:
Stamps are standardized, community-wide recognition


Same criteria for every user


Earned less frequently than badges


Meant to be public and comparable


Rules:
Stamp criteria are fixed and platform-defined


Stamps represent meaningful milestones or behavior patterns


Stamps should not be trivial or easily farmed


Stamps may appear on user profiles when they are being viewed 


Examples:
“Consistent Logger” (logged activity X days in Y window)


“Fitness Fanatic” (reached declared fitness goal)


“Focused” (hit weekly focus goal for multiple weeks)


“Comeback” (returned after inactivity and logged consistently)



4. Language & UX Constraints


Badges = personal ownership


Stamps = system-verified recognition



5. Non-Goals (Important)
Do not merge badges and stamps into one system


Do not allow stamps to be user-defined


Do not auto-adjust Focus Point values based on recognition


Recognition should reflect behavior, not influence point economics
