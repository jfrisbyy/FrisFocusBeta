I need to consolidate my "FrisFit" fitness app into this project as a single, feature-rich "Fitness Dashboard" page.

On the fitness page, use a Tabbed Interface to switch between 5 distinct views. It must connect to API endpoints so it can be stored to the account and include ALL of the following specific features:

1. Tab: Overview (Dashboard)

Vitals Row: Display current Daily Calories, Deficit Status, Protein Total, Current Weight, and Next Milestone.
Activity Feed: A list of the most recent logs from all categories combined.
Quick Actions: Big buttons to immediately "Log Meal", "Log Run", or "Log Lift".
Weekly Streak: A visual indicator of consecutive days active.
2. Tab: Nutrition (Macro & Deficit Tracker)

Daily Summary: Progress bars for Calories and Protein vs Goals.
Deficit Mode: A specific section calculating (Goal - Food Intake + Calories Burned).
Meal Logger: A generic list of meals for the day (Name, Cals, Protein, Time) with Add/Delete functionality.
Daily Toggles: Checkboxes for "Creatine Taken" and "Water Gallon Drank".
Deficit Calculator: A modal/dialog to calculate calorie targets based on Weight, Height, Age, and Activity Level.
History: List of past daily logs.
3. Tab: Sports (Basketball & Skill Work)

Consolidated View: This tab should have its own internal toggle/sub-tabs to switch between "Pickup Games" and "Skill Drills".

Sub-View A: Pickup Games (Hoops)

Note: Tracks competitive games, not cardio.
Session Logger: Inputs for Date, Duration, Court Type (Full/Half), and Multi-Select Format (1v1, 3v3, 5v5, 21, KOC).
Game Stats: Track Games Played, Wins, Losses, and calculate a "Win Rate %".
Performance GPA: Dropdown to grade performance (A+ to F), converted to a GPA score.
Mental Game: Confidence slider (1-10) and Reflection text areas.
Challenges: Add specific session goals (e.g., "5 Assists") with Target vs. Achieved inputs.
Sub-View B: Skill Lab (Drills)

Session Logger: Inputs for Date, Drill Type, and Intensity/Effort % (Slider).
Zone Focus: Sliders to estimate time spent in Paint, Mid-Range, and 3-Point (visualized in a Pie Chart).
Drill Stats: List to track specific drills (Name, Reps Made).
Focus Tags: Multi-select badges for skills (e.g., "Handles", "Shooting").
Intensity Gauge: Visual bar showing avg effort level across sessions.
4. Tab: Strength (Lifting)

Workout Logger: Inputs for Date, Duration, and Primary Focus (Push/Pull/Legs).
Exercise Grid: Dynamic list for Exercises (Name, Sets, Reps, Weight).
Volume Analytics: Auto-calculate "Total Volume" (lbs lifted) per session.
Charts: Bar Chart for Volume Progression and Pie Chart for Focus Area breakdown.
5. Tab: Body Comp (Weight & Photos)

Check-in Logger: Inputs for Date, Current Weight, and Body Fat %.
Photo Upload: File input to attach a progress picture to the log.
Goal Settings: Persistent section to set "Goal Weight" and "Next Milestone".
Visuals: Area Chart for weight trends and a "Before/After" photo gallery view.



Ensure all "Delete" and "Edit" actions work for every log type.
